# Project 1 - simple-clustering app. - 
https://github.com/KingsCafe/Mike_Portfolio/blob/main/clustering.py
#### a simple application to predict whether with a customer's characteristic entered will be purchased or not using Random Forest and Streamlit.
below images file showing how's the app works.

# Project 2 - Macdonald's Menu Analysis - 
https://github.com/KingsCafe/Mike_Portfolio/blob/main/macdonal_menu_analysis_with_jupyter.ipynb
#### To analyze each menu category and provide insights on nutrition content:

Business Understanding:
1. Food that contains highest fiber content
2. calories in macdonald's food
3. Explore content of daily average % of cholesterol and sodium in McDonald's menu versus other nutrition.
4. average daily % of each nutrition in McDonald's menu

# Project 3 - Departmental Store RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) with MySQL -
https://github.com/KingsCafe/Mike_Portfolio/blob/main/Departmental%20Store%20RFM%20Analysis%20with%20MySQL.sql
1. to idenfity customer types based on their RFM scores.
2. scores ranking (Quartiles system) ==> 1=lowest;2=low;3=high,4=highest
3. This method uses clustering to launch targeted marketing campaigns based on their profile - for illustration purposes only we'll be focused on customers that we would like to reward them for being a good and loyal customers:
- Champions (average rfm score > 3.5) --> bought most recently, most often and big spenders
- loyal customers (average rfm score between 3.0 and 3.5) --> good sependers and responsive to promotions
- potential loyalists (average rfm score between 2.5 and 3.0) --> recent customer, bought more than once and spent fair amount
4. our targeted customers for the campaign this time:

# Project 4 - ETL, Data Analysis and Visualization with Python - 
https://github.com/KingsCafe/Mike_Portfolio/blob/main/ETL%20with%20Python.ipynb
#### Race results for the 2017 Intel Great Place to Run \ Urban Clash Games!
1. extract the information table from url using Beautifulsoup and transform into Pandas dataframe to perform data cleaning
2. save the table to local file and perform data analysis and visualization:
- change time format into numeric in minutes
- use column chart to visualize top 10 cities participated in the race
- get insight of running times distribution with distribution chart and boxplot
- to compare the running times between female and male with boxplot
